# Data Analysis for Business Project - Brazilian Houses Analysis

The minds behind this: **Chiara Baldoni**, **Sofia Bruni**, **Francesca Romana Sanna** and **Mattia Sebastiani**, five students of the Bachelor in Management and Computer Science.

This project aims to predict rent prices in major Brazilian cities, providing crucial insights for new companies entering the real estate market. By identifying key factors influencing rental prices and segmenting the market geographically, we equip newcomers with the knowledge needed to make informed investment decisions and optimize their pricing strategies.
